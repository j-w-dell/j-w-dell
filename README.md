Iâ€™m J. W. Dell, a chemist with degrees from the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA, USA) and Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH, USA).

My research interests include organic synthesis, homogeneous and organometallic catalysis, machine learning and neural network applications in molecular biophysics and catalysis, and materials and renewable energy.

Object-oriented programming is my current strong suit, and I'm learning more about scientific Python libraries (like NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and smaller/more specialized codebases) for use in physical chemistry simulations and visualizations along with density functional theory (DFT) methods for electronic structure computations.

You can find here a few of the repositories I've drawn on in my brief efforts as an undergraduate computational biophysics research assistant (with Professor Paul Robustelli, Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH, USA)). The rest of my work is private for academic honor and pre-publication confidentiality reasons. My primary research efforts during the last year of my undergraduate career at Dartmouth were for an organic total synthesis project with Professor Gordon Gribble.

As a member of the [Gunnoe lab](https://gunnoelab.virginia.edu/) at UVA (led by Professor T. Brent Gunnoe), I specialized in organometallics and collaborated with theoretical chemists at Brigham Young University (Provo, UT, USA) to join my synthesis and computational interests as I earned a masters degree.
